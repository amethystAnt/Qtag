Qtag is (or will be) a cross-platform application for editing audio tags written in Qt. 
It is licensed under the Mozzila Public License v2.0. ( https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/index.txt )
This project is not ready for using yet, if you want to edit audio tags, use another application, e.g. Kid3 or EasyTag 
(these are both good, but I want to make a better application which combines the positive aspects of them).
