Qtag is a new cross-platform Qt-based application for editing audio tags. 
It is licensed under the Mozzila Public License v2.0. ( https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/index.txt )
I currently work on an RPM and DEB package, and a Windows installer as well. I might release the first version in a couple of days.
If you want to compile it right now, install Qt 5 and TagLib (and obviously GNU G++ and Git) and open a command line:
$git clone http://www.github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag.git
$cd Qtag/src
$qmake #on Fedora, it might be qmake-qt5 instead
$make
$./Qtag

If you'd like to compile it on Windows or OS X, do it on your own.
