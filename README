**INSTALLATION:**

  Installer binaries can be found at https://github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag-installer/releases/
  However, you might find out that there is no installer for your system, then you might need to compile the software.
  Some advice on that can be found in the sections below.

**Unix:**

  On Unix, you probably need to compile it if there is no installer for your system.
  Install Qt 5 and TagLib (and obviously GCC and Git) and open a command line:

    $ git clone http://www.github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag.git
    $ git checkout stable
    $ cd Qtag/src
    $ qmake-qt5 # or just "qmake" might also work, depends on your system
    $ make
    # make install

  If you wish to specify the installation path of the binary (the default is /usr/local/bin), use this command instead of qmake-qt5:
    $ qmake-qt5 -after "binary.path=/desired/path"

  This has been tested on some Linux systems as well as MacOS.
  On Mac, you might face some problems when trying to run the compiled app that must be solved individually on your system.

  Note: it is strongly recommended that you use the latest version of TagLib (at least 1.10) to avoid some bugs.

**Windows:**
