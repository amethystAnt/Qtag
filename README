Qtag is a Unix / Windows application for editing audio tags written in Qt. 
It is licensed under the Mozzila Public License v2.0.
This project is not ready for using yet, if you want to edit audio tags, use another application, e.g. Kid3 or EasyTag 
(these are both good, but I want to make a better application which combines the positive aspects of them).
