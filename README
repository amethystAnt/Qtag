**MacOS**

  Download a DMG image here: https://github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag/releases/

**Windows:**

  Download an installer here: https://github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag-installer/releases/

**Unix (except macOS):**

  On Unix, you probably need to compile it if there is no installer for your system.
  Install Qt 5 and TagLib (and obviously GCC and Git) and open a command line:

    $ git clone http://www.github.com/amethystAnt/Qtag.git
    $ git checkout stable
    $ cd Qtag/src
    $ qmake-qt5 # or just "qmake" might also work, depends on your system
    $ make
    # make install

  If you wish to specify the installation path of the binary (the default is /usr/local/bin), use this command instead of qmake-qt5:
    $ qmake-qt5 -after "binary.path=/desired/path"

  This has been tested on some Linux systems, namely Ubuntu and Fedora.
  Note: it is strongly recommended that you use the latest version of TagLib (at least 1.10) to avoid some bugs.
