openMusicTagger is a Unix / Windows application for editing audio tags written in Qt. 
This project is a remake of an older version (github.com/amethystAnt/openMusicTagger-0.-), which was completely useless.
It is licensed under the Mozzila Public License v2.0.
This project is not ready for using yet, if you want to edit audio tags, you can use the older version, 
but I recommend you to use another application, because the older version is not a good example of an audio tag editor.
Once this project will be ready for using, I'm going to rewrite this readme file and delete the old 
version of openMusicTagger.
